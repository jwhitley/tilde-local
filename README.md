# tilde-local

This repository is part of my versioned home directory system.  See
[vcsh-root](https://github.com/jwhitley/vcsh-root) for the 'root' of this
multi-repository system.

This repository versions files a `~/local` hierarchy, akin to `/usr/local`,
where various useful tools and man pages can reside in a system-independent
fashion.

System independent scripts reside in `~/local/bin`, while various OS-specific
tools reside in `~/local/<OS>/bin`.
