.PP

.PP
To use a different vimrc with vimpager, put your settings into a
~/.vimpagerrc or ~/.vim/vimpagerrc or a file pointed to by the
VIMPAGER_RC environment variable.
.PP
You can also have a global config file for all users in /etc/vimpagerrc,
users can override it by creating a ~/.vimpagerrc or a
~/.vim/vimpagerrc.
.PP
These are the keys for paging while in vimpager, they are the same as in
less for the most part:

.TE
.PP
To disable loading plugins, put "set noloadplugins" into a vimpagerrc
file.
.PP
You can also switch on the "vimpager" variable in your vimrc to set
alternate settings for vimpager.
.PP
If you want to disable less compatibility mode, and use regular vim
motion commands, put this into your .vimrc/vimpagerrc:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
let\ g:vimpager_less_mode\ =\ 0
\f[]
.fi
.PP
You can still enable less mode with this setting by pressing ",v".
.PP
At runtime whenever less mode is toggled with ,v , this variable will
reflect the current state, regardless of the initial value.
.PP
Put the following into your .vimrc/vimpagerrc if you want to use
gvim/MacVim for your pager window:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
let\ g:vimpager_use_gvim\ =\ 1
\f[]
.fi
.PP
To turn off the feature of passing through text that is smaller than the
terminal height use this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
let\ g:vimpager_passthrough\ =\ 0
\f[]
.fi
.PP
See "PASSTHROUGH MODE" further down.
.PP
To start vim with \-X (no x11 connection, a bit faster startup) put the
following into your .vimrc/vimpagerrc:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
let\ g:vimpager_disable_x11\ =\ 1
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The scroll offset (:help scrolloff), may be specified by placing the
following into your .vimrc/vimpagerrc (default = 5, disable = 0):
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
let\ g:vimpager_scrolloff\ =\ 5
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The default is 5 only in less mode, with less mode disabled the default
is the user\[aq]s scrolloff setting.
.PP
The process tree of vimpager is available in the "vimpager_ptree"
variable, an example usage is as follows:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
if\ exists("vimpager")
\ \ if\ exists("vimpager_ptree")\ &&\ vimpager_ptree[\-2]\ ==\ \[aq]wman\[aq]
\ \ \ \ set\ ft=man
\ \ endif
endif
\f[]
.fi
.PP
To disable the use of AnsiEsc.vim to display ANSI colors in the source,
set:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
let\ g:vimpager_disable_ansiesc\ =\ 1
\f[]
.fi
.PP
see the section "ANSI ESCAPE SEQUENCES AND OVERSTRIKES" for more
details.
.SH COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
.SS + | +G
.PP
Start at the end of the file, just like less.
.SS \-c cmd
.PP
Run a vim command after opening the file.
Multiple \-c arguments are supported.
.SS \-\-cmd cmd
.PP
Run a vim command when entering vim before anything else.
Multiple \-\-cmd arguments are supported.
.SS \-u vimrc
.PP
Use alternate .vimrc or .vimpagerrc.
.SS \-s
.PP
Squeeze blank lines into a single blank line.
GNU man passes this option to /usr/bin/pager.
.SH ANSI ESCAPE SEQUENCES AND OVERSTRIKES
.PP
If your source is using ANSI escape codes, the AnsiEsc plugin will be
used to show them, rather than the normal vim highlighting, however read
the caveats below.
If this is not possible, they will be stripped out and normal vim
highlighting will be used instead.
.PP
Overstrikes such as in man pages will always be removed.
.PP
vimpager bundles the
AnsiEsc (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4979) plugin
(it is expanded at runtime, there is nothing you have to do to enable
it.)
.PP
However, your vim must have been compiled with the \[aq]conceal\[aq]
feature enabled.
To check, try
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
:echo\ has("conceal")
\f[]
.fi
.PP
if the result is \[aq]1\[aq] you have conceal, if it\[aq]s \[aq]0\[aq]
you do not, and the AnsiEsc plugin will not be enabled.
.PP
If you\[aq]re on a Mac, the system vim does not enable this feature,
install vim from Homebrew.
.PP
To disable the use of AnsiEsc.vim, set:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
let\ g:vimpager_disable_ansiesc\ =\ 1
\f[]
.fi
.PP
in your .vimrc.
.PP
If the file has a modeline that sets ft or syntax, the setting will
override the use of AnsiEsc.
.PP
To turn off AnsiEsc while viewing a file, simply run
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
:AnsiEsc
\f[]
.fi
.PP
To turn off AnsiEsc on the commandline, use an invocation such as the
following:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
vimpager\ \-c\ \[aq]au\ VimEnter\ *\ exe\ "setlocal\ syntax=".&syntax\[aq]\ somefile
\f[]
.fi
.SH PASSTHROUGH MODE
.PP
If the text sent to the pager is smaller than the terminal window, then
it will be displayed without vim as text.
If it has ansi codes, they will be preserved, otherwise the text will be
highlighted with vimcat.
.PP
You can turn this off by putting
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
let\ g:vimpager_passthrough\ =\ 0
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Passthrough mode requires a POSIX shell with arithmetic expansion, if
there is one on your system and it is not detected please submit an
issue with the path and your OS version.
.SH CYGWIN/MSYS/MSYS2 NOTES
.PP
vimpager works correctly with the native Windows gvim, just put it in
your PATH and set the vimpager_use_gvim option as described above.
